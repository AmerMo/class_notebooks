# Machine Learning II Notebooks

This repo holds some of the notebooks used in machine learning II sessions @ IE.

To work will all dependencies:

    git clone git@github.com:renero/class_notebooks.git
    cd class_notebooks
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The class `Dataset` still needs more documentation, but feel free to contribute and experiment with it via pull request.
