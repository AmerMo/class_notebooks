# Machine Learning Notebooks

This repo keeps the notebooks used in Machine Learning sessions.

To work will all dependencies:

    git clone git@github.com:renero/class_notebooks.git
    cd class_notebooks
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The class `Dataset` still needs more documentation, but feel free to contribute and experiment with it via pull request. The class is available in [this repo](https://github.com/renero/dataset)

If you want to use it, I recommend to install via pip with a link to the source, in case you want to update or pull it regularly:

    $ cd dataset
    $ pip install -e .
